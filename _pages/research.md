My recent research interests (2016-2024) are <b>rock fracture mechanics</b> and <b>nondestructive testing</b> (e.g. acoustic emission, AE and micro-computed tomography, Micro-CT). Understanding the cracking behavior (i.e. initiation, propagation, and coalescence) of rocks in the subsurface is important for rock engineering such as enhanced geothermal systems (EGS), geological disposal of nuclear waste, and CO<sub>2</sub> geological storage. More specifically, in EGS, hydraulic fracturing is used to enhance the permeability of the often tight crystalline rocks in geothermal reservoirs by creating a system of open and well-connected fracture networks. In the geological disposal of nuclear waste, the cracking and failure of originally impermeable host rocks can create pathways for radionuclides to escape the disposal site, potentially reaching the biosphere. During the long-term geological storage of CO<sub>2</sub>, rock-CO<sub>2</sub> interaction including the dissolution and precipitation of minerals could alter the mechanical properties of rocks. Such changes could result in the fracturing of rock formations, posing risks to the integrity and stability of the storage site. However, in the field, one can rarely directly observe the cracking processes and must rely on indirect information such as micro-seismicity induced by the cracking processes. It is often challenging to infer the cracking behavior from micro-seismic data given the complex conditions (e.g. in-situ stress, lithology) that may affect their relations. As an experimentalist, I make used of well-controlled experimental tests to understand the cracking mechanisms and their relations with lab-scale microsesimicity, AE of rocks under different conditions. My research provides the basis for interpreting the microseismicity induced by rock cracking in these rock engineering projects

A comprehensive study on the nucleation, growth, and interaction of microcracks (i.e. microcracking) and the associated fracture process zones (FPZs) of rocks is crucial for better understanding and predicting subsequent macrocracking processes. My doctoral project focused on the <b>microcracking mechanisms of granite</b> using a <b>multi-scale crack characterization method</b> integrating AE and microscopic observation techniques such as scanning electron microscopy and petrographic microscopy. Since granite is a common host rock in EGS geological disposal of nuclear waste, my research could contribute to managing the efficacy of EGS or the safety of geological disposal of nuclear waste.
