# About me
I am an **experimentalist** and **data scientist** specializing in rock mechanics and engineering geology. I earned my Ph.D. in rock mechanics under the mentorship of [Prof. Louis Wong](https://www.earthsciences.hku.hk/people/academic_staff/77/?back=af3a6f1ace1fc32210286eb66ab8ef53) from the [Department of Earth Sciences](https://www.earthsciences.hku.hk/) at [the University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/) . I am a Postdoctoral Scholar at the [Rock Physics and Geomaterials Lab](https://rgl.stanford.edu/), working with [Prof. Tiziana Vanorio](https://profiles.stanford.edu/tiziana-vanorio?releaseVersion=10.8.0), at [Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability](https://sustainability.stanford.edu/). I have an interdisciplinary background and am proficient in combining methods from Rock Mechanics, Geophysics, Geology, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to tackle scientific challenges in rock engineering relevant to energy transition and climate change.

**Research Interests:** Rock Mechanics, Acoustic emission, AI4Rock Engineering, Carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS)

# Motivation and Vision
My motivation of doing research stems from a deep desire to **advance science** by **making discoveries** and **developing innovative techniques**. I am particularly passionate about the research and technology that have the potential to **foster a more sustainable society** while also promoting **diversity, inclusion and social justice**.

In the future, I aim to leverage my experience and expertise to address scientific challenges in rock engineering that contribute to achieving **Net Zero**, such as **enhanced geothermal systems (EGS)** and **nuclear waste geological disposal**, which are closely related to utilizing non-carbon (e.g. geothermal and nuclear) energy, as well as **CO<sub>2</sub> geological storage**
