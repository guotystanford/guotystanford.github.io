## The effects of loading mode:
<p align="justify">
I have developed a constitutive model to capture the anisotropic mechanical response of transversely isotropic rocks by extending the modified Cam-Clay model with an alternative stress state transformed with a rank-four projection tensor that contains the information of the spatial orientation of the bedding structures[1]. Using the proposed model, I conducted stress-point simulations of plane strain compression test on overconsolidated Tournemire shale, and the result is demonstrated in the figure below:

## The effects of rock texture:
<p align="justify">
As a contributing author, I contributed to the development of the Cam-Clay IX model that considers anisotropy, material heterogeneity, and viscoplasticity of shale[2]. This model can properly quantify the mechanical response of shale with different material compositions. Besides, it can capture time-dependent processes such as creep and relaxation in shale. Moreover, for the first time reported in the literature, we showed that a shear band can form in a shale specimen even with a constant load when the viscosity in its mechanical response is considered, a phenomenon we called “creep-induced strain localization”. The following figures demonstrate the evolution of creep induced shear bands in a specimen with a weak spot, and in a specimen consists of heterogeneous materials:
