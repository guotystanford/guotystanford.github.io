## The effects of loading mode:
<p align="justify">
We investigated the effects of loading condition on the cracking behavior of a medium-grained granite under mixed-mode I-II loadings. We found that the macrocrack paths near the pre-existing notch tip are closely related to the microcracking behavior illuminated by AEs. Most of the macrocrack paths traverse the region with high AE event density. For the AE event density contours corresponding to the fully-developed fracture process zones (FD-FPZs), their shape is sub-circular and symmetric with respect to the pre-existing notch under mode I loading, while those under the mixed-mode I-II loadings are irregular and asymmetric By conducting the moment tensor inversion, we found that the presence of mode II loading component alters the AE source mechanisms with regard to the temporal evolution features of event-type ratios preceding the unstable propagation of macrocracks.

## The effects of rock texture:
<p align="justify">
Rocks are natural materials with diverse microstructures which control their mechanical behavior. This study investigated the effects of texture of three lithologies-granite marble, and sandstone-on their microcracking mechanisms. Results indicate that <b>rock texture and pre-existing microcracks are the primary factors controlling the microcracking mechanisms and the associated AE features [2].</b> This study highlights the importance of considering microscopic features when interpreting AE or micro-seismic data related to rock cracking.
