## The effects of loading mode:
<p align="justify">
We investigated the effects of loading condition on the cracking behavior of a medium-grained granite under mixed-mode I-II loadings. We found that the macrocrack paths near the pre-existing notch tip are closely related to the microcracking behavior illuminated by AEs. <b>Most of the macrocrack paths traverse the region with high AE event density</b>. For the AE event density contours corresponding to the fully-developed fracture process zones (FD-FPZs), their shape is <b>sub-circular and symmetric</b> with respect to the pre-existing notch under <b>mode I loading</b>, while those under the <b>mixed-mode I-II loadings</b> are <b>irregular and asymmetric.</b> By conducting the moment tensor inversion, we found that <b>the presence of mode II loading component alters the AE source mechanisms</b> with regard to the temporal evolution features of event-type ratios preceding the unstable propagation of macrocracks.

## The effects of rock texture:
<p align="justify">
Rocks are natural materials with diverse microstructures which control their mechanical behavior. This study investigated the effects of texture of three lithologies-granite marble, and sandstone-on their microcracking mechanisms. Results indicate that <b>rock texture and pre-existing microcracks are the primary factors controlling the microcracking mechanisms and the associated AE features [2].</b> This study highlights the importance of considering microscopic features when interpreting AE or micro-seismic data related to rock cracking.
