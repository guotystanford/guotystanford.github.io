## The effects of loading mode:
<p align="justify">
I have developed a constitutive model to capture the anisotropic mechanical response of transversely isotropic rocks by extending the modified Cam-Clay model with an alternative stress state transformed with a rank-four projection tensor that contains the information of the spatial orientation of the bedding structures[1]. Using the proposed model, I conducted stress-point simulations of plane strain compression test on overconsolidated Tournemire shale, and the result is demonstrated in the figure below:

## The effects of rock texture:
<p align="justify">
Rocks are natural materials with diverse microstructures which control their mechanical behavior. This study investigated the effects of texture of three lithologies-granite marble, and sandstone-on their microcracking mechanisms. Results indicate that <b>rock texture and pre-existing microcracks are the primary factors controlling the microcracking mechanisms and the associated AE features [2].</b> This study highlights the importance of considering microscopic features when interpreting AE or micro-seismic data related to rock cracking.
